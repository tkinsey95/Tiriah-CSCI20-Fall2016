/*
This is a simple number guessing game

First

Select random number between 1 and 20.
Get user input. 
If user guesses the selected number, the user wins and receives 10 points. 
Else if user guesses the selected number, tell the user "higher".
Else if user guesses higher than the selected number, tell user "lower".
For every wrong guess, take 1 point from the 10 points the user has.
Continue this until the user guesses the correct number or loses all of its points.

End
